If you want to use the modules pressure- and densitiyCalculation,
you need to install and compile fressteam on your system.
In these modules, freesteam is used to precalculate pressure and density values
in a custom range after the IAPWS-IF97 formulations.

To get the latest freesteam version and help for installation see:
