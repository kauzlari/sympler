/*!
 * Implementation of a random per particle force F acting on a \a point_t stored in the tag. The force takes a square matrix B as user input and \a m_factor *B operates on a random vector dW with one random number per particle of the user defined colour, i.e., as SDE,  dFdt=\a m_factor *B.dW. The corresponding random numbers are drawn from a normal distribution N(mu=0,sigma^2=1). NOTE: The force will only work properly if no particles are created or destroyed! It is the user's responsibility to provide a square matrix of appropriate size, which must be in binary format. If addressed by four indices p1, d1, p2, d2 they will be used in exactly this (reverse) order as d2+p2*SPACE_DIMS+d1*SPACE_DIMS*Np+p1*SPACE_DIMS*Np*SPACE_DIMS, where p1, p2 are particle indices, d1, d2 are indexing cartesian coordinates, SPACE_DIMS is the number of dimensions and Np is the number of particles of the user-defined colour.
