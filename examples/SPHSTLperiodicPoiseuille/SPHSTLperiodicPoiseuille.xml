As you can see, the strategy in this input file is to set the cutoff to 1. An alternative strategy is to set it to 2, 2.5, 3 for the M4, M5, M6 (3rd, 4th, 5th order), respectively. Reasonable particle distances/densities or the normalisation of the interpolants will for example depend on this choice.

      The number of timesteps ("100000") is currently chosen such that one can see the onset of instabilities (starting roughly at timestep 66000 ~ 1.6 s). Even at timestep 300000 (~ 7.5 s), the simulation is still running and the velocities are still in the right order of magnitude, but one observes significant oscillating deviations from the expected parabolic velocity profile. 
      The size of the timestep dt = "0.005" is limited in this simulation (Reynolds-number ~ 7) by the CFL-condition dt <~ 0.25*d/c ~ 0.0081*[t] [1]. For further limitations (not dominating here), see [1,2]. The factor 0.25 is approximate and empirical. It varies slightly depending on the specific SPH-setup (e.g. kernel, cutoff). d=(rho/m)^(-1/3), i.e., the distance of nearest neighbours in a cubic lattice, is here chosen as the characteristic disretisation length. Other groups do that differently, but the order of magnitude is the same. c is the chosen artificial speed of sound. See the pressure gradient term below for more details about c.

    <!-- We try 8 particles in the cross-section: It has been tested, e.g., in Phys. Rev. E 67 (2003) 026705, that >=6 cutoffs are required to resolve a given wavelength properly. If we approximate the expected parabolic velocity profile of Poiseuille flow by a half-wave, then we need >=3cutoffs = 3. For our choice of 2.6 particles per cutoff (in a simple cubic lattice), this means that we need 3x2.6=7.8, i.e. a minimum of 8 particles. The box-sizes result from that. In y-direction and in z-direction, they just result from the periodicity. In z-direction, we take the absolute minimum of >= 2 cutoffs such that the particles don't see their periodic image. In the laminar regime, all particles in z-direction should behave the same (periodic) way. In the simulation this is true as long as no instabilities occur.
	 In x-direction, we additionally enforce, that the wall particles on the "left" and on the "right" have equal distance to the wall-boundary. This is currently a bit cumbersome since the wall particles are created (in a cubic lattice), by extending the bounding box by 1 cutoff beyond each wall and then starting with the first wall particle at 0.5*d from the "lower end" of the bounding box. Only for cutoffs which are multiples of 0.5*d, this does not require any manual adjustment. But here we have a nearest particle-distance in a cubic lattice of d = 1/2.6. In fact, this even complicates the adjustment of the channel width in real units (see above for units). Therefore, the TODO-list for the SYMPLER-code already contains a simplification of this issue.-->
