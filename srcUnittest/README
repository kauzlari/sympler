Instructions for contributors creating and integrating new UnitTests to sympler:

______________________________________________________________________
1. step: Write unit tests
Unit tests always test a specific class ClassName, usually implemented 
in a correspnding class_name.cpp in the src-directory.
To integrate your files class_nameTest.h and class_nameTest.cpp, put 
them into the analogous srcUnittest-directory:
class_nameTest.h to srcUnittest/.../head and class_nameTest.cpp to 
srcUnittest/.../source

______________________________________________________________________
2. step: Adapt Makefiles
You need to tell the Makefiles that there is new code required to be 
compiled:
Add "class_nameTest.h" to include_HEADERS in 
srcUnittest/.../head/Makefile.am ("include_HEADERS = class_nameTest.h")
Add "class_nameTest.cpp" to lib~Test_la_SOURCES in 
srcUnittest/.../source/Makefile.am 
("lib~Test_la_SOURCES = class_nameTest.cpp")

______________________________________________________________________
IMPORTANT
Every time a new file (e.g. unit tests) is added to the source code,
the entire sympler-code need to be re-configured and re-compiled.

______________________________________________________________________
There are currently two simple unit test examples for your reference:
The structure of a unit test without functionality can be found in 
every subdirectory and can be used as a template for new unit tests.
A full unit test of the VertexList-class: src/geometry/...
